How to start a project on Laravel with tests? And if those tests are on back-end and on front-end? 
   
Sometimes having two different test DSLs (domain specific languages), it isn't such cool too.  
  
At this project I only configured Laravel to work on with ReactJS, and added to both, test libraries which follow the "spec" DSL: Kahlan Framework for Php Tests and Jest + Enzyme for ReactJS tests.  
  
(Kahlan Framework for PHP Modern Tests in "spec" DSL pattern:

(Eloquent Phony for PHP Modern Mocks, spies and stubs.  
https://github.com/eloquent/phony  
    
(Jest and Enzyme for React Tests) 
https://github.com/facebook/jest  
https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme  

I also installed and configured the "Eloquent Phony" library for Mocks, stubs, and spies using a modern way.
